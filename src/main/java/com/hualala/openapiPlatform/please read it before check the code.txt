This is an interactive system for visualizing the data by using Springboot+Mybatis framework.

Now let me introduce it and you can get in to a specific file to read the comments of each function.

The Controller has two files, BDController and DBController. The BDController has two functions, 
1. queryAllCounty¡ªmainly provides information for the main front page, 
2.queryACounty¡ªget the info of One specific county for the second page. DBController is related 
to saving records from csv files ( after spark, linear calculations and etc. )to databases for query.

The mapper package has two files. BfPredictMapper.class is an interface of BfPredictMapper.xml
 of the package of resources.mapper. When using the Springboot framework, we could just use the
 function of this mapper to search, delete, add records and etc.

The package named model.dto has 5 class¡ª3 of them are entities (I send entities to the front-page), 
and two of them named xxExample are templates for the framework.

The package service has two files, one interface named BDService and another Implementation of this 
interface called BDserviceImpl, which is a bridge between the controllers and the mappers.

The file named Application is the main function of this system.

The package recourses includes some css, js, html, xml files, the mapper provides SQLs, 
static is those css and javascript files. The templates has the htmls for the frontpage.

For javascript files, the drawGraph.js and autoGraphForMainPage.js are two files written by me, 
others are download from some libraries. As the name shows, those two files are related to draw the graphs.

application.yml is the properties of this system, including the database info, the framework info and etc.

mybatis-generator-config is a very important part for the framework, to generate SQL code according 
to my requirements.

logback-spring.xml and mybatis-config.xml are non-related to our final assignments.


Databases:
I put the 2 tables with the code.
